## What are environment variables?

Every program on Linux has an environment, like a bash- or zsh-shell, that it runs in. These shells can contain variables that can change how OmniOpt2 works. Here is a list of all shell variables that change how OmniOpt2 works.

It is important that you run these commands before you run OmniOpt2, and also that you write <samp>export</samp> in front of them. Unexported variables are not passed to programs started by the shell.

## Table of environment variables
