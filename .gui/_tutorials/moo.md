## What is MOO?

Sometimes, you have several goals in mind when optimizing your neural network. For example, you may want to minimize two goals that conflict with each other. For example, you want to minimize your loss, but also minimize the time a prediction takes. Usually, better results mean that your network needs more time. With OmniOpt2, you can optimize for both. This will not give you a single result, but rather a so-called [Pareto-Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front) of results, of which you can then choose one that best fits your needs. OmniOpt2 allows you to use as as many RESULT-values as you wish.

## How to use Multi-Objective-Optimization with OmniOpt2?

It's very similar to using [single-optimization](tutorials?tutorial=run_sh), the only differences being that, instead of using

```python
print(f"RESULT: {loss}")
```

you now need two (or as many as you have Objectives) lines:

```python
print(f"LOSS: {loss}")
```

and

```python
print(f"PREDICTION_TIME: {prediction_time}")
```

and you need the option

```bash
--result_names LOSS PREDICTION_TIME
```

The Extra-option can be set in the GUI in the *Show additional parameters*-table at the bottom at the option called *Result-Names*. It accepts a space-separated list of result-names that are then used internally to search through the stdout of your program-to-be-optimized. You can use up to roughly 20 RESULT-names.

## How to minimize one and maximize the other parameter?

By default, OmniOpt2 minimizes all parameters. Minimizing one and maximizing another parameter can easily be done though, by specifying it in the RESULT-Names-Parameter:

```bash
--result_names LOSS=min PREDICTION_TIME=max
```

This way, LOSS is minimized, while PREDICTION_TIME is maximized.

## How to calculate Pareto-Fronts in cancelled jobs

When you have a job that was cancelled for whatever reason (ie. time limit, memory limit, ...), but you still had results and want to calculate the Pareto-Front afterwards, you can do that by simply calling:

```bash
./omniopt --calculate_pareto_front_of_job runs/yourproject/0
```

This will calculate the pareto fronts, and, when you had `--live_share` enabled, will automatically push these results to the OmniOpt2-[Share](tutorials?tutorial=oo_share) server. This can also be done manually, by calling `omniopt_share` on the run folder.

## Algorithm for determining Pareto-Front-Estimation

By default, [NSGA-II](https://pymoo.org/algorithms/moo/nsga2.html) by the **pymoo**-module is used.

## What is NSGA-II?

NSGA-II is a special kind of genetic algorithm. A genetic algorithm is a method inspired by how nature evolves things over time. It tries to find the best solutions to a problem by creating "populations" of possible answers and improving them over generations.

## What makes NSGA-II special?

NSGA-II is used when we want to find **more than one goal** at the same time (multi-objective optimization). For example, we might want a car that's both **fast** and **cheap**, but these goals often compete.

## Caveats
<div class="caveat warning">
Using MOO prohibits most of the graphs you can usually plot with OmniOpt2, since the result-value is not unambiguous anymore and cannot be used for plotting easily. We'd recommend using [OmniOpt2-Share](tutorials?tutorial=oo_share) to plot Parallel plots of your data in the browser.
